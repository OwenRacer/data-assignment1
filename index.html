    <h1> Heat & Mental Health in New York City</h1>

    <h2> With each summer hotter than the last, climate change’s behavioral health toll is increasingly excelling an unwanted outcome; heat-stemming violence, especially in urban heat islands.

    <p> Psychological services like climate therapy are one of many avenues to cope with the mental effects of extreme heat, which has been linked to a 4 percent to 6 percent increase in interpersonal violence and a 0.7 percent increase in suicides. Violence is an all-too-common result of one of the increasingly harshest elements of climate change, heat.  </p>

<p> Working in parallel to combat the intersection of heat and violence are a slew of violence prevention efforts, of which New York City is boosting no shortage of. </p>

<p> Far too often it is falsely believed that individuals with a mental illness are violent, however, this stereotype has been proven questionable, as people with mental health conditions are actually more likely to be victims of violence. Although, access to mental health care is still inequitable, often unaffordable, and out of insurance for many. </p>

<p> With 350 New Yorkers dying from heat each year, city data shows that Black residents are more than twice as likely to die from heat than White residents. Although the correlation between heat and violence is known to be the result of elevated heart rate and blood pressure, rising heat from climate change is more frequently talked about in other metrics, like dollar signs. A recent study capturing national attention found the U.S. is losing 2.5 billion hours of work and $100 billion in economic loss per year due to heat. </p>

<p> While we can measure dollars and New York City’s rank as having the nation's highest Urban Heat Index (UH), 9.5 degrees Fahrenheit, the true mental toll of rising heat is a story only beginning to be told as many grapple with the blaze in silence. </p>

    <p>If the temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit with a humidity of 65%, than the heat index is 121, or what it feels like outside. </p>

    <p>On average, more than 65,000 people enter the emergency room each summer with heat-related illnesses.</p>

    <p>In a study of over 2.2 million adults who visited emergency departments between 2010 and 2019, nearly eight percent more visits for mental health concerns on the hottest days of summer than on the coolest days</p>
